      <p>
        Hello there, welcome to my corner of the digital world! I'm April
        Liggons, and I'm thrilled to share my journey with you. In September
        2023, I made a bold decision to pivot from my role as a pharmacy
        technician to pursue my passion as a Front-End Developer. As someone who
        thrives on challenges and embraces change, this transition felt like a
        natural evolution for me. While my background may seem unrelated, I
        firmly believe that my experiences in the pharmaceutical industry have
        eqipped me with invaluable skills that I now apply to my new path. My
        journey into the world of tech has been nothing short of amazing. From
        learning the fundamentals of HTML and CSS to exploring Javascript and
        beyond, each step has been a thrilling adventure. I'm constantly amazed
        by the power of code to bring idea to life and shape the digital
        landscape.
      </p>
      <p>
        But beyond the technical aspects, my journey is also about growth and
        personal development. I've learned the importance of perseverance and
        curiosity - qualities that I carry with me with every project I
        undertake. As I continue to perfect my skills and expand my knowledge,
        I'm driven by a deep sense of purpose ad a desire to make a meaningful
        impact. Whether it's creating intuitive user interfaces or creating
        immersive web experiences, I'm committed to pushing the boundaries of
        what's possible in the world of Front-end Development. Also, I am
        excited to see where this jouney takes me and the impact I can make as a
        developer. With dedication, passion, and willingness to embrace the
        unknown, I'm ready to carve out my place in this evolving field.
